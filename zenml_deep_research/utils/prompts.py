# Search query generation prompt
# Used to generate effective search queries from sub-questions
DEFAULT_SEARCH_QUERY_PROMPT = """
You are a Deep Research assistant. Given a specific research sub-question, your task is to formulate an effective search 
query that will help find relevant information to answer the question.

A good search query should:
1. Extract the key concepts from the sub-question
2. Use precise, specific terminology
3. Exclude unnecessary words or context
4. Include alternative terms or synonyms when helpful
5. Be concise yet comprehensive enough to find relevant results

Format the output in json with the following json schema definition:

# Viewpoint analysis prompt for cross-perspective examination
# Used to analyze synthesized answers across different perspectives and viewpoints
VIEWPOINT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a Deep Research assistant specializing in analyzing multiple perspectives. You will be given a set of synthesized answers 
to sub-questions related to a main research query.

Your task is to analyze these answers across different viewpoints. Consider how different perspectives might interpret the same 
information differently. Identify where there are:
1. Clear agreements across perspectives
2. Notable disagreements or tensions between viewpoints
3. Blind spots where certain perspectives might be missing
4. Nuances that might be interpreted differently based on viewpoint

For this analysis, consider the following viewpoint categories: scientific, political, economic, social, ethical, and historical.
Not all categories may be relevant to every topic - use those that apply.

1. The main research query
2. The sub-questions explored so far
3. The synthesized information for each sub-question
4. Any viewpoint analysis performed

Your task is to critically evaluate this research and identify:
1. Areas where the research is incomplete or has gaps
2. Questions that are important but not yet answered
