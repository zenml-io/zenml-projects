# 🏷 Continuous Annotation with Label Studio

Data annotation / labeling is a core part of MLOps that is frequently left out
of the conversation. ZenML offers a way to build continuous annotation
(combining training and annotation into a loop) with Label Studio. This uses a
combination of user-defined steps as well as some built-in steps that ZenML
provides.

## 🗺 Overview

NOTE: This example currently only runs with a cloud artifact store. [This guide
by Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/guide/storage.html) contains more details
if you have trouble understanding the instructions below.

For a full video walkthrough on how to run this example, please check out [our
community hour demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLFGnoApWeU) in which we
show how to run the various pipelines, in what order, all using an AWS stack.

# 🖥 Run the example

In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML and Label
Studio.

```shell
pip install "zenml[server]" torchvision

# clone the ZenML repository
git clone https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git
cd examples/label_studio_annotation

# Initialize ZenML repo
zenml init

# Start the ZenServer to enable dashboard access
zenml up
```

You will need to install and start Label Studio locally:

```shell
zenml integration install label_studio

# start label-studio locally
label-studio start -p 8093
```

To connect ZenML to your local Label Studio server, you also need an API key.
This will give you access to the web annotation interface.

First order of business is to sign up if you haven't done so already, using an
email and a password. Then visit [http://localhost:8093/](http://localhost:8093/) to log in, and then
visit [http://localhost:8093/user/account](http://localhost:8093/user/account) and get your Label Studio API key (from
the upper right hand corner). You will need it for later. Keep the
Label Studio server running, because the ZenML Label Studio annotator will use
it as the backend.

## 👣 Step-by-Step Infrastructure Setup

Pick your preferred infrastructure provider from Azure, GCP and AWS. Then follow
the relevant guide below for how to set up the infrastructure required by this
example.

### 🥞 Set up your stack for Microsoft Azure

You should install the relevant integrations:

```shell
zenml integration install pytorch azure pillow
```

Some setup for your stack is required.

A resource group will allow you to clean up any associated resources easily, so
either create one with the following command, or reference an existing one in
what follows. The same applies to the storage account and container that we'll
create and use:

```bash
az group create --name <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --location northeurope

az storage account create --name <YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --location northeurope --sku Standard_ZRS --encryption-services blob

az storage container create \
    --account-name <YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> \
    --name <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME> \
    --auth-mode login
```

At this point you'll want to get a storage account key with the following
command:

```bash
az storage account keys list --account-name <YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

You can pick either of the 'value' properties to use for the `--account-key`
value for the following command that adds CORS permissions to your storage
account:

```bash
az storage cors add --origins '*' --methods GET --allowed-headers '*' --exposed-headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' --max-age 3600 --services blob --account-key <YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY> --account-name <YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

Now we can set up all the necessary ZenML components:

```shell
zenml stack copy default <ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME>

zenml stack set <ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME>

zenml secret create <YOUR_AZURE_AUTH_SECRET_NAME> --account_name="<YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>" --account_key="<YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY>"

zenml artifact-store register <YOUR_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_STORE> -f azure --path="az://<YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME>" --authentication_secret="<YOUR_AZURE_AUTH_SECRET_NAME>"

zenml stack update <ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME> -a <YOUR_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_STORE>

zenml secret create <LABEL_STUDIO_SECRET_NAME> --api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"

zenml annotator register <YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_ANNOTATOR> --flavor label_studio --authentication_secret="<LABEL_STUDIO_SECRET_NAME>"

zenml stack update <ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME> -an <YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_ANNOTATOR>
```

At this point you should stop (`CTRL-C`) Label Studio, set the following two
environment variables (or do it wherever is appropriate if you have a deployed
Label Studio instance) before restarting Label Studio:

```bash
export AZURE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME="<YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>"
export AZURE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_KEY="<YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY>"
```

### 🥞 Set up your stack for GCP

You should install the relevant integrations:

```shell
zenml integration install label_studio pytorch gcp pillow
```

This setup guide assumes that you have installed and are able to use the
`gcloud` CLI to run commands.

Create your artifact store and set up the necessary permissions and service
accounts:

```shell
gsutil mb -p <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME> -l <YOUR_GCP_REGION_NAME> -c standard "gs://<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>"

gcloud iam service-accounts create <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME> --member="serviceAccount:<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/storage.admin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME> --member="serviceAccount:<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ls-annotation-credentials.json --iam-account=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME>.iam.gserviceaccount.com

gsutil cors set cloud_config/gcp/cors-config.json gs://<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
```

Now you have a credentials `json` file that you can use to authenticate with
Label Studio. Make sure to note down the path where this was created.

Now you can set up the rest of your stack:

```shell
zenml stack copy default <YOUR_ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME>

zenml stack set <YOUR_ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME>

zenml secret create <YOUR_GCP_AUTH_SECRETS_NAME> --token="@PATH/TO/JSON/FILE/CREATED/ABOVE"

zenml artifact-store register gcp_artifact_store -f gcp --path="gs://<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>" --authentication_secret="<YOUR_GCP_AUTH_SECRETS_NAME>"

zenml stack update <YOUR_ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME> -a <YOUR_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_STORE>

zenml secret create <LABEL_STUDIO_SECRET_NAME> --api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"

zenml annotator register <YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_ANNOTATOR> --flavor label_studio --authentication_secret="<LABEL_STUDIO_SECRET_NAME>"

zenml stack update <YOUR_ANNOTATION_STACK_NAME> -an <YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_ANNOTATOR>
```

Be sure also to set the environment variable for your GCP credentials and then
restart Label Studio:

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<PATH_TO_YOUR_CREDENTIALS>"
label-studio start -p 8093
```

### 🥞 Set up your stack for AWS

You should install the relevant integrations:

```shell
# assuming label_studio was installed earlier
zenml integration install pytorch s3 pillow
```

Create your basic S3 bucket via CLI command:

```shell
REGION=<YOUR_DESIRED_AWS_REGION>
S3_BUCKET_NAME=<YOUR_DESIRED_S3_BUCKET_NAME>

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket=$S3_BUCKET_NAME --region=$REGION --create-bucket-configuration=LocationConstraint=$REGION
```

Label Studio also needs you to set up cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
access to your bucket, using a policy that allows `GET` access from the same
host name as your Label Studio deployment. You can use the CORS file we have
pre-populated for you inside the examples repo as follows:

```shell
cd cloud_config/aws
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket $S3_BUCKET_NAME --cors-configuration file://cors.json
cd ../..
```

You will also need to assign a policy to your IAM user that allows it to access
the S3 bucket in the way that Label Studio needs. You can do this using [the
instructions described in the Label Studio
documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/storage.html#Configure-access-to-your-S3-bucket)
(step two, specifically).

Now you can get to the fun part of setting up Label Studio and working with
ZenML:

```shell
YOUR_AWS_ZENML_STACK_NAME=<YOUR_AWS_ZENML_STACK_NAME>
YOUR_ARTIFACT_STORE_NAME=<YOUR_ARTIFACT_STORE_NAME>

zenml stack copy default $YOUR_AWS_ZENML_STACK_NAME

zenml stack set $YOUR_AWS_ZENML_STACK_NAME

# use your standard access key id and secret access key from ~/.aws/credentials here
zenml secret create <YOUR_AWS_SECRET_NAME> --aws_access_key_id="<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>" --aws_secret_access_key="<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"

zenml artifact-store register $YOUR_ARTIFACT_STORE_NAME --flavor=s3 --path=s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME --authentication_secret="<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_NAME>"

zenml stack update $YOUR_AWS_ZENML_STACK_NAME -a $YOUR_ARTIFACT_STORE_NAME

zenml secret create <LABEL_STUDIO_SECRET_NAME> --api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"

zenml annotator register <YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_ANNOTATOR> --flavor label_studio --authentication_secret="<LABEL_STUDIO_SECRET_NAME>"

zenml stack update $YOUR_AWS_ZENML_STACK_NAME -an <YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_ANNOTATOR>
```

### ▶️ Run the Code

There are several parts to running the pipeline. Start with:

```shell
python run.py --train
```

On the first time you run this, this will fetch a pretrained model and amend the
head so that it is able to perform binary image classification. It does not get
finetuned at this point, however.

You can use the CLI command to view our newly created dataset:

```
zenml annotator dataset list
```

It will show that we now have an `aria_detector` dataset.

Then you can use this model to perform inference on some images (located in
`data/batch_1`). These 'pre-annotations' will then be synchronized with Label
Studio.

```shell
python run.py --inference
```

At this point you should do some annotation using the Label Studio web
interface, making sure to annotate all the ten images. You can launch the
annotation interface with the CLI:

```shell
zenml annotator dataset launch aria_detector
```

When you're done, you can get the stats on the annotation work you did by using
the ZenML CLI:

```shell
zenml annotator dataset stats aria_detector
```

This will tell you how many labeled and unlabeled tasks you have for your Label
Studio dataset.

With the annotations complete, you should rerun the training step. This time
instead of just pulling a pretrained model, the step will finetune our
previously-downloaded pretrained model using the ten annotations we just made.
This will improve our model's performance (a bit).

```shell
python run.py --train --rerun
```

Now we can rerun the inference step, though using a different set of data
(`data/batch_2`).

```shell
python run.py --inference --rerun
```

Once we've rerun this step, we can inspect the predictions our newly fine-tuned
model made within Label Studio.

## CLI Commands for the Label Studio Integration

Once you've run the pipeline for the first time, you'll be able to use some 
ZenML CLI commands to interact with your Label Studio annotations and the
dataset:

```shell
# the obvious ones to try
zenml annotator describe
zenml annotator dataset list
zenml annotator dataset <YOUR_DATASET_NAME> stats
```

### 🧽 Clean up

In order to clean up, delete any relevant cloud infrastructure that was created
above (the cloud storage bucket is the main one, along with any permissions and
whatever secrets or secrets vaults you created) and the remaining ZenML
references. If you created assets under a GCP project, or an Azure resource
group, then the newly created assets should be easy to find. With Amazon,
the IAM rules and the S3 bucket are what you need to delete.
