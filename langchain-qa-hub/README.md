# ZenML Hub Example: QA with LangChain, LLamaIndex and OpenAI

This example demonstrates how to build a question-answering (QA) bot using the ZenML Hub, an open repository for ZenML integrations, plugins, and community-contributed code. The example utilizes the `langchain_qa_example plugin` from the ZenML Hub, which provides a pre-built pipeline for fetching data, creating an index, and answering queries using GPT-3.5 (and beyond) language models powered by OpenAI.

## Getting Started

To run the QA pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Install the `langchain_qa_example` plugin from ZenML Hub using the following command:

    ```bash
    zenml hub install langchain_qa_example
    ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY> # Get it from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
    ```

3. Import and run the `build_zenml_docs_qa_pipeline` function from the `langchain_qa_example` plugin, passing in the desired question as a parameter. For example:

    ```python
    from zenml.hub.langchain_qa_example import build_zenml_docs_qa_pipeline
    
    # Specify the question to be answered
    question = "What is ZenML?"
    
    # Run the QA pipeline
    pipeline = build_zenml_docs_qa_pipeline(question=question, load_all_paths=False).run()
    ```

The pipeline will fetch data from the ZenML documentation, create an index, and use the GPT-3.5 language model to answer the question based on the corpus.

## Customizing the Data Source

The example can also be customized to use a different data source. For instance, you can modify the pipeline to fetch data from a specific URL of your choice by using the `web_url_loader_step` from the `langchain_qa_example` plugin. Here's an example:

```python
from zenml.hub.langchain_qa_example import web_url_loader_step, WebUrlLoaderParameters

# Specify the URLs to fetch data from
urls = ["https://zenml.io/integrations/"]

# Update the pipeline with the custom data loader
qa_pipeline(
    document_loader=web_url_loader_step(WebUrlLoaderParameters(urls=urls)),
    index_generator=index_generator_step(),
    question_answerer=question_answerer_step(
        QAParameters(question="Name five tools that ZenML integrates with.")
    ),
).run()
```

This will fetch data from the specified URLs, create an index, and answer a different question based on the custom data.
