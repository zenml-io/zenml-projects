    "A couple weeks ago, we were looking for a fun project to work on for the next chapter of our ZenHacks. During our initial discussions, we realized that it would be really great to work with an NBA dataset, as we could quickly get close to a real-life application like a \"3-Pointer Predictor\" while simultaneously entertaining ourselves with one of the trending topics within our team.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were building the dataset around a \"3-Pointer Predictor\", we realized that there is one factor that we need to take into consideration first: Stephen Curry, The Baby Faced Assassin. In our opinion, there is no denying that he changed the way that the games are played in the NBA and we wanted to actually prove that this was the case first. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why our story in this ZenHack will start with a pipeline dedicated to drift detection. As the breakpoint of this drift, we will be using the famous \"Double Bang\" game that the Golden State Warriors played against Oklahoma City Thunder back in 2016. Following that, we will build a training pipeline which will generate a model that predicts the number of three-pointers made by a team in a single game, and ultimately, we will use these trained models and create an inference pipeline for the upcoming matches in the NBA."

Machine learning pipelines are built on top of data inputs, so it is worth checking for drift if you have a model that was trained on a certain distribution of data. The incoming data is something you have less control over and since things often change out in the real world, you should have a plan for knowing when things have shifted. Evidently offers a [growing set of features](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) that help you monitor not only data drift but other key aspects like target drift and so on."
