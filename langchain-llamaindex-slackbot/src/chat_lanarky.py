QUESTION: Why should I use ZenML?
=========
Content: Everyone loves to train ML models, but few talks about shipping them into production, and even fewer can do it well. At ZenML, we believe the journey from model development to production doesn't need to be long and painful.
 | Source: https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/introduction
Content: With ZenML, you can concentrate on what you do best - developing ML models and not worry about infrastructure or deployment tools.
 | Source: https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/introduction
Content: ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. It's built for data scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate as they develop to production. ZenML has simple, flexible syntax, is cloud- and tool-agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions that are catered towards ML workflows. ZenML brings together all your favorite tools in one place so you can tailor your workflow to cater your needs.
 | Source: https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/introduction
Content: If you come from unstructured notebooks or scripts with lots of manual processes, ZenML will make the path to production easier and faster for you and your team. Using ZenML allows you to own the entire pipeline - from experimentation to production.
